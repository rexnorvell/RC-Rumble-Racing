# RC-Rumble-Racing
This is a Python implementation of a game called RC Rumble Racing. In the game, the player ventures on a solo campaign across several tracks. To unlock the next track, the user must beat the AI “ghost” on the current track. The racing itself is a top-down view of the current track as the player controls the car with their keyboard.
